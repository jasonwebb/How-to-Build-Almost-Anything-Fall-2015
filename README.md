Courseware and student content from "How to Build Almost Anything" course at Metropolitan Community College's FabLab in Omaha, NE.

#### About the class ###
"How to Build Almost Anything" is an 11-week (one "quarter" or "term) course offered through the [FabLab](http://fablab.mccinfo.net/) at the Metropolitan Community College in Omaha, NE, USA. This particular class was taught on Wednesday evenings from 6PM to 9:40PM, and is therefore structured as an intensive lecture and project-based experience.

Although each session individually is intended to be relatively fast-paced and highly focused, it is not the intent of this class to train students to become deeply knowledegable "power users" in any of the topics discussed. Instead, this class is meant to introduce novices, often with zero exposure to digital fabrication technology, to the basics of a variety of topics with the goal that motivated students who become interested in any particular topic are equipped well enough with knowledge to be able to interface with experts and perform their own indepedant research with less frustration and confusion.

With this in mind, the content of this course is intended to be implemented in a heavily project-based, experiential and hands-on format with minimal use of traditional classroom lecturing and Powerpoint presentations. Because every topic in this course requires self-driven exploration and hands-on experience, it should be the goal of the facilitator of this content to keep the students active, engaged and curious through any means necessary.
